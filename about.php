		<td valign="top">Cooleman Ridge Park Care Group Inc. is one of a number 
		of park care groups around Canberra which take an interest in our Nature 
		Parks. Thanks to the work of members, weeds are kept down, tracks are maintained 
		and native trees, bushes and grasses are planted.
		<p>The group was formed in 1991. Since then it has removed the majority 
		of the woody weeds <i>Pyracantha, Rosa rubiginosa</i> (Sweet Briar), etc, 
		and greatly reduced thistles and <i>Verbascum.</i> Large areas of <i>Phalaris</i> 
		grass have been cut to reduce fire fuel. Native tree plantations have been 
		established and mid-storey plants and native grasses put in to many areas. 
		Only indigenous trees and plants are used.</p>
