				<h2>About the Group</h2>
				
				<p>
				Cooleman Ridge Park Care Group Inc. is one of a number 
				of park care groups around Canberra which take an interest in our Nature 
				Parks. Thanks to the work of members, weeds are kept down, tracks are maintained 
				and native trees, bushes and grasses are planted.
				</p>
					
				<p>The group was formed in 1991. Since then it has removed the majority 
				of the woody weeds <i>Pyracantha, Rosa rubiginosa</i> (Sweet Briar), etc, 
				and greatly reduced thistles and <i>Verbascum.</i> Large areas of <i>Phalaris</i> 
				grass have been cut to reduce fire fuel. Native tree plantations have been 
				established and mid-storey plants and native grasses put in to many areas. 
				Only indigenous trees and plants are used.</p>
				
				<h2>Activities</h2>
				
				<p>
					Members typically have their own small area to caretake 
					and also cooperate to work over the whole area at monthly meetings. This 
					enables us to have an overall strategy and help each other on the larger 
					jobs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group meets once a month on the third Sunday. Our
					<a href="news.php">newsletter</a> gives details. Smaller groups meet weekly 
					on Monday and Friday mornings.
