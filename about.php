				<h3>About the Group</h3>
				
				<p>
				The Cooleman Ridge Park Care Group is a <a href="http://www.environment.act.gov.au/parks-conservation/parks-and-reserves/get-involved/parkcare-and-urban-landcare-program">ParkCare</a> group that &quot;cares&quot; for the Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve.
                </p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>

                <p>
                The mission of the Cooleman Ridge Park Care Group is to &quot;restore the bush&quot; by returning the ecology of the nature reserve to it's pre-European state.
                </p>



                <h3>History</h3>

				<p>The group was formed in 1991 by three ladies - Bess Sledge, Pauline Lynga and Tina Nevins.

                    The group has now grown to have 50 registered members that contribute in various ways with small but active core of members that regulary meet and work on the nature reserve.

<!--                    Since then it has removed the majority -->
<!--				of the woody weeds <i>Pyracantha, Rosa rubiginosa</i> (Sweet Briar), etc, -->
<!--				and greatly reduced thistles and <i>Verbascum.</i> Large areas of <i>Phalaris</i> -->
<!--				grass have been cut to reduce fire fuel. Native tree plantations have been -->
<!--				established and mid-storey plants and native grasses put in to many areas. -->
<!--				Only indigenous trees and plants are used.-->

                </p>


                <h3>Meetings</h3>

                <p>
				The group meets once a month on the third Sunday of every month for a group working party. The group works on one of designated group work areas.
                Please see our latest <a href="news.php">newsletter</a> for the specific details for our next meeting.
