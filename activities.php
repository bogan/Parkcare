<!--
<p>
   Thanks to the work of members, weeds are kept down, tracks are maintained
    and native trees, bushes and grasses are planted.

    Members typically have their own small area to caretake
    and also cooperate to work over the whole area at monthly meetings. This
    enables us to have an overall strategy and help each other on the larger
    jobs.
