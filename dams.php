        However, the rainfall is not reliable and one day the dam was a dry hole
        with a bird platform in the middle of it. Throughout the years the water
        level in the dam has been varying between complete dryness like in August
        2004 and a good amount of water as most of the time afterwards.</p>


        <p>A series of almost <a href="dam/2004.php">300 photos of the dam</a> between 2003 and 2012 have been
        taken by Pauline and Gösta Lyngå. Unfortunately, photos taken before
        January 2003 were destroyed in a bushfire. The photographic survey of the
        dam is continued by Arminel and Pat Ryan. </p>

        <p>The Kathner Street dam is now the subject of regular Water Watch studies
        and enjoyed by wildlife as well as by visitors, particularly when a multitude
        of frogs give their evening concerts. </p>
