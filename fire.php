		<td>We have been very excited by the regrowth of some of the flora and the 
		appearance of certain natives in sections where they weren't seen before. 
		Most are small, however, and you need to know what you are looking for to 
		see them. To the untrained eye the Ridge is just a large expanse of exotic 
		grasses, but underneath are hidden treasures. Did you notice the pictures 
		of ferns on this site? They are native to the area and are used in the group's 
		logo. They have come back strongly. Lomandras (at first glance a bit like 
		grass) grew in large numbers last summer. Cooleman Ridge is suffering more 
		from the drought than from the fires, which caused some loss of trees but 
		benefitted other plants.
		<p></p>
		<p>New members are always welcome. The area will recover in time: if you 
		want to help us help it along, please contact us. You may not, for instance, 
		know that we were beginning to plant native grasses on the Ridge: these 
		are better than pasture grasses in a fire, as they tend to stay greener 
		near the ground, reducing the fuel load available to the fire. Off-the-top-of-the-head 
		estimates suggested it would take 50-100 years to replace all the grasses 
		with the few resources we have - all the more reason to start now!</p>
