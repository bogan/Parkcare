            <h2 class="page-header">Fire</h2>

            <p>Fire is an important part of the ecology and long term management of the ridge. Fire has played a sometimes controversial part in the ridge. This page is intended to give a brief overview of the histroy, role and management of fire on the ridge.</p>


            <h3>History</h3>

            <!-- Today -->

            <p>The history of fire on the ridge has stronly followed the <a href="history.php"> history</a> of the ridge itself. the role of humans has been the most significant factor in the frequency, intensity and effect of fires on the ridge.</p>

            <p>Fire has been present on the ridge for millions of years.</p>

            <p>Artificial burning was introduced by Aborigines who regularly burned, low intenstity burns. to better manage the land for their purposes</p>

            <p>European settlers generally believed that fire was only bad as it not only destroyed food but risked destroying intrastructure such as fences, sheds and homes. Fire was therefore generally suppressed.</p>

            <p>When the ridge was converted from a grazing property to a nature service in the 1980s, there were very few fires occured on the ridge prior to january 2003.</p>

            <p>Since January 2003n the ridge nowdays can be planned or unplanned. Planned fires are conducted by the rural fire service with the objective being to reduce the amount of fuel. This helps reduce the possibility and intensity of an uncontrolled fires on the ridge.</p>


            <p>Since then fires have been a regular occurrence. Since the 20003 fires are now more actively managed.</p>


            <h3>Management</h3>

            <p>
                fires are now managed different. The right balance between too much and too little fire.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fires are manage by the rural service.
            </p>

            <p>
                controlled burns have been a regular almost annual feature of the fire management on the ridge since
            </p>

            <p>
                Controlled burns typically target only a small area of the ridge at a time. Progressively overtime, the ridge is burnt. This pattern of burning mosaic burning.
            </p>


            <p>
                The use of controlled of hazard reduction burns has many secondary benefits on the ridge.</p>

            </a>

            <h3>Weeds</h3>

            <p>
                Weeds play an important factor in the role of fire on the ridge.
            </p>

            <p>
                A balanced fire management regime can be beneficial to both humans and the general environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The group plays an important role in reducing the risk, intensity and impact of unplanned fires.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many pasture grasses (such as Phalaris, Rye Grass, Fescue and Wild Oats), were deliberately introduced by former graziers when the ridge used to be part of pastoral properties.
            </p>

            <p>
                They were introduced because native grasses were considered to be a poor food source for large grazing animals (eg. horses, cows, sheep).
            </p>

            <p>
                the fuel load of native grasses and forbs is generally much lower that that of many weeds.
            </p>

            <p>
                These pasture grasses have  a much larger biomass.
            </p>

            <p>
                The very qualities that made it a good pasture grass (thick, tall and fast growing) are the very qualities that make it the biggest fire hazard on the ridge. It can rapidly increase the speed and intensity of grass fires.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biomass of many weeds is much greater than that of many natives. This biomass makes them a much more significant fuel source
            </p>

            <p>
                Their fuel load is therefore much smaller than introduced pasture grasses.
            </p>

            <p>
                many of the the weeds on the ridge play an important role in fires. they are a major fuel source.
            </p>

            <p>
                These weeds were not a major fuel problem when they were actively grazed. However, now that regular grazing has been removed, they become a more significant problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Introduced pasture grasses when they are no longer grazed pose a significant fire hazard.
            </p>


            <p>
                These grasses when  grazed regularly have a minimal affect. However, when they are no longer grazed, they dry out</p>

            <p>Most native grasses on the ridge, in contrast are much smaller and sparse. They pose a much smaller fire risk.

                burn slower and cooler than many pasture grasses.

            <p>By replacing introduce pasture grasses with native grasses, the fuel load is significantly reduced.</p>

            <p>The long term goal is to remove the pasture grasses and thereby significantly reduce the associated fire hazard.</p>

            <h3>Regeneration</h3>

            <p>
                A major secondary benefit of controlled burns is that these burns can signficantly accelerate the regeneration of the bush.
            </p>

            <p>
                A balanced fire management regime can have significantly assist in the regeneration of the bush. Too much and things don't do well. To little and things don't do well.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the group areas have had one or more burns on them. This has significantly enhanced the ratural regeneration process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Native generally respond better to regular burns than exotics. Burns help accelerate the regeneration of native plants and grasses in particular.
            </p>

            <p>
                Controlled burns also provide a great opportunity for the group. The group takes advantage of control burns as a good opportunity. Vegetation cover is reduced, weeds are more visible and easier to remove.

					<h2>Webmaster's Note</h2>

					<h3>Photographs</h3>

					<p>
						Some photos belonging to members have been destroyed in the fire. If 
						you can donate photos to be included in the group's archives, please contact 
						us. Our members collect data and photos about the Ridge's vegetation for 
						scientific purposes. We plan to scan all photos and burn them to a CD, keeping 
						a backup copy in a different location to the originals.
					</p>

					<h3>Regeneration</h3>
		
					<p>
						We have been very excited by the regrowth of some of the flora and the 
						appearance of certain natives in sections where they weren't seen before. 
						Most are small, however, and you need to know what you are looking for to 
						see them. To the untrained eye the Ridge is just a large expanse of exotic 
						grasses, but underneath are hidden treasures. Did you notice the pictures 
						of ferns on this site? They are native to the area and are used in the group's 
						logo. They have come back strongly. Lomandras (at first glance a bit like 
						grass) grew in large numbers last summer. Cooleman Ridge is suffering more 
						from the drought than from the fires, which caused some loss of trees but 
						benefitted other plants.
					</p>
		
					<p>
						New members are always welcome. The area will recover in time: if you 
						want to help us help it along, please contact us. You may not, for instance, 
						know that we were beginning to plant native grasses on the Ridge: these 
						are better than pasture grasses in a fire, as they tend to stay greener 
						near the ground, reducing the fuel load available to the fire. Off-the-top-of-the-head 
						estimates suggested it would take 50-100 years to replace all the grasses 
						with the few resources we have - all the more reason to start now!
