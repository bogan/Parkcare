        The quality of different sections ranges from very poor to very good. Weeds still form a major part of the ridge. the balance weetwen good and bad areas has significantly moved towards the good over the approximately 25 history of the group. In contrast, the best areas of the ridge are generally been covered by our <a href="groupareas.php">Group Areas</a>. Many high quality areas also exist outside of the group areas.

        The group conducts various surveys that relate to the flora found on the ridge. This include the <a href="plants.php">Plant Survey</a>, the <a href="trees.php">Tree Survey</a> and the <a href="blackberrys.php">Blackberry Survey</a>. These surveys serve many purposes from management through to simple interest.</p>
