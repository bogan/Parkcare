				The city of Canberra is built largely on rocks of Ordovician age (420 
				million years old). At the time the rocks formed, and in fact for most of 
				the Palaeozoic era, the eastern margin of the Australian continent was an 
				active margin. That is, the Australian continental plate was overriding 
				the oceanic crust to the east. This resulted in the formation of troughs 
				seaward from the continent and in the development of a volcanic arc landward 
				from the margin. The best modem analogy is perhaps the western Pacific, 
				especially the area around Japan and China. Canberra during the Ordovician 
				was then a busy place with active volcanoes to the west of the city while 
				beneath the city was a trough which varied in depth as the volcanoes poured 
				out occasional streams of lava and vast quantities of ash (sometimes the 
				trough was filled with ocean water sometimes there were lakes). Towards 
				the end of the Palaeozoic the region entered a long period of mountain building. 
				The area was uplifted and large granite batholiths were intruded as a high 
				temperature liquid into the core of the mountain range (the granites can 
				be seen around Tidbinbilla). Thus, since the ancient rocks of the Canberra 
				area were deposited there has been a long period of erosion to arrive at 
				our present landscape. As a consequence our soils are old and most of the 
				readily soluble minerals have long since been dissolved and carried away 
				in the streams.</p>
			
				<p>Cooleman Ridge (our local park system) sits almost entirely on Ordovician 
				volcanic rocks referred to as the Laidlaw Volcanic Suite. This suite is 
				divided into two units or formations which are slightly different in composition. 
				The older unit is referred to as the Deakin Volcanics and the younger unit 
				as the Laidlaw Volcanics. The lavas and volcanic ashes in these formations 
				are referred to as rhyolites and dacites. Chemically, by comparison with 
				other volcanic rocks, they contain a relatively high proportion of silica 
				(SiO2) and are thus "acid" volcanics which are similar in composition to 
				granites formed at much greater depths in the earth's crust.</p>

				At the northern end of the ridge, just outside the park in the pine forest 
				on Narrabundah Hill, the Deakin Volcanics are exposed. They appear as rather 
				poor outcrops of rubbly boulders scattered about the hill but are perhaps 
				best seen at the trig station on top of the hill. The rocks consist of ignimbrites, 
				tuffs and water-lain sediments. Ignimbrites are formed when gas-supported 
				flows of extremely hot volcanic ash pour down the sides of active volcanoes 
				as rapidly moving clouds. As the ignimbrites came to rest they were still 
				so hot that the ash fragments welded together forming a solid rock that 
				is often difficult to distinguish from lava. Volcanic ash by contrast was 
				ejected well up into the atmosphere where it cooled before settling out 
				to form ash layers over large areas of the countryside. Ash layers are often 
				eroded by subsequent rains and carried into local lakes to form water-lain 
				sediments. Anyone wanting to see this unit in more detail, and prepared 
				to risk life and limb, should walk the road cutting along the Tuggeranong 
				Parkway from the Cotter Road overpass to the Hindmarsh Drive overpass. This 
				unit underlies much of the Weston Creek area.</p>
	
				<p>
				Walking south from the Narrabundah Trig Station you drop down into the 
				saddle forming the headwaters of Bulgar Creek (where Hindmarsh Drive becomes 
				Eucumbene Drive) before climbing back up the hill towards Cooleman Trig 
				(above Chapman) and into the park. This saddle forms the boundary between 
				the Deakin Volcanics and the Laidlaw Volcanics. The Laidlaw Volcanics form 
				the foundations for part of Rivett, all of Chapman and parts of Stirling 
				and Fisher. However, most importantly they underlie most of Cooleman Ridge 
				to Mount Arawang and beyond to the south. Like the Deakin Volcanics the 
				Laidlaw Volcanics consist in large part of ignimbrites but also include 
				small amounts of volcanic ash as well as sediments deposited in the ocean 
				rather than in lakes. In general, to the casual observer the two units are 
				quite similar. The Laidlaw Volcanics generally are more resistant to weathering 
				and form higher rockier hills than the Deakin Volcanics.</p>
				
				<p>Further south from Mount Arawang beyond the southern limit of our park 
				we come to Neighbour Hill (to the west of Kambah) and a little further to 
				the west Forster Hill (closer to the Murrumbidgee River). These two hills 
				consist of porphyry very similar in chemical composition to the Laidlaw 
				Volcanic Suite but intruded into the volcanics at depth in the earth's crust. 
				The porphyries are Silurian in age and are some millions of years younger 
				than the Laidlaw Volcanic Suite. Porphyries, because they were intruded 
				at depth and unlike volcanic lavas and ashes, had some time to cool. However, 
				they were not intruded at great depth and as a consequence the minerals 
				they contain have not all had the opportunity to crystallise fully. Consequently, 
				we find that some minerals such as quartz and feldspar have developed as 
				large crystals (up to 2 cm) while the rest of the rock forms a very fine 
				matrix.</p>
