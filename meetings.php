    <h3>Group Meetings</h3>

    <p>
        The group meets once a month for a group working party. The group works on one of designated group <a href="groupareas.php">work areas</a>. The group will perform many hands on works in accordance with our accepted <a href="methods.php">methods</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Group Meeting is normally held on the third Sunday of every month (except when there are public holidays such as Christmas or Easter). Please see our latest <a href="news.php">newsletter</a> for the specific details for the exact time and place for our next meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
        And afterwards, for the boys and girls that have been good, tea and cake is often served!
    </p>

    <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>

    <p>
        There are also smaller weekly work groups that focus on just one specific area of the nature reserve. These include:
        <ul>
            <li>Kathner Street Group - every Friday morning at the Kathner Street Dam site</li>
            <li>Arawang Group - every Wednesday morning at the Mt Arawang site</li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
        These groups are made up of a smaller subset of the group and focus on a particular area outside of our regular group areas.
    </p>

    <h3>Annual General Meeting</h3>

    <p>
        The group holds an annual general meeting every October. The primary purpose of the meeting is to elect the <a href="structure.php">committee members</a> for the forthcoming year.
    </p>

    <p>
        The committee then also performs strategic planning for the next year.
