    <h2 class="page-header">Methods</h2>

    <p>The Cooleman Ridge Parkcare group uses its own variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Bradley Method</a>  to regenerate the bush. The effectiveness of this method is proven and is now widely accepted throughout Australian "landcare" groups as the most cost effective method to regenerated the bush.

    <p>The Bradley Method is however counter intuitive to those unfamiliar with it. This is because it emphasises "weeding over planting". It maintains that an hours weeding gives a much better return than an hours planting. Weeding is by no means a futile activity. A well targeted and executed weeding strategy can have achieve major results quickly. The main advantages of weeding over planting are summarised in the following table:
    </p>

    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Planting</th>
            <th>Weeding</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Cost</th>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Low</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Mortality</th>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Low</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Variety</th>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The main reason why weeding is more effective than planting is that the bush has a natural tendency to regenerate anyway, whether humans help or not. However, humans can great significantly accelerate the natural regeneration process by removing competitors that prevent the bush from regeneration. Weeds compete for light, water and nutrients. Removing weeds allows struggling natives to maximise the use. The idea is to create an empty space for the bush to move into. The bush will do this naturally. All it requires from us is to create this space. This is the main reason for weeding - to remove competition and create a space.

<p>Weeding should by lightweight rather than heavy weight. Weeding is most effective in strong areas rather than week areas. Many think that weeding is futile because they will just come back. Once a good native cover is established, most weeds rarely reenter. Work with the bush rather than against it.  </p>


    <p>Many different weeding techniques are used on the ridge, both by the group itself as well its partners. These include:

    <div class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Hacking</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>Hacking is the main form of weeding performed the group. It is generally performed with a small pick and simply involves digging out small weeds. It is most effective against small to medium herbaceous weeds that have distinctive rosette, such as Aaron's Rod, Wild Sage, Scotch Thistle and Plantain. Large areas. It is a very precise method that removes the weed while leaving natives immediately next to the weed. </p>

    <div class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Poisoning</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>Poisoning involves the application of some herbicde to the plant. The herbicide is generally a glyophasate based one that does not harm the enviroment nor humans. Poisons are typically applied using two different methods - spraying or cut-and-dabbing. </p>

            <p>It is possible</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Smothering</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Burning</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Beheading</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>This technique is best used with slower growing tall weeds such as Aaron's Rod and Fleabane.</p>

    <p>
        Each technique is target at the specific weeds concerned. Some weeds are more effectively managed than others.
    Each has its place in the toolkit.
    </p>


    <p>
        Many major weeds our now largely extinct from the ridge and many are well on their way to be declaring them extinct.
