				<h2>Location</h2>
		
				<p>Cooleman Ridge is situated between Chapman 
				and Kambah lying north-west to south-east, about 3.5 km long with an area 
				of 187 ha. Its highest point is Mt Arawang (765 m) with a general level 
				of 600 m above sea level. It offers extensive views east and north over 
				Canberra and west over the Brindabella mountain range.</p>
		
				<h2>Recent History</h2>
		
				<p>Cooleman Ridge has been grazed by sheep 
				and cattle for over a hundred years and consequently has many exotic grasses 
				and weeds. As part of 'Yarralumla' property, 1899 maps indicate open forest. 
				Latterly it was part of the 'Cooleman' grazing property when it was sown 
				with <i>Phalaris</i> pasture grass and fertilised. It has been part of Canberra 
				Nature Park formally since 1993 but was a reserve before that.</p>
		
				<h2>Geology</h2>
		
				<p>Did you know that Cooleman Ridge, like 
				most of Canberra, sits on rocks 420 million years old? Volcanic activity, 
				the ocean, lakes and weathering have all played their part in forming today's 
				landscape. Read Dr. John F. Lindsay's interesting <a href="geology.php">
				article</a> for more information about the geology of the area.</p>
