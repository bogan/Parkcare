    <h2 class="page-header">Strategy</h2>

    <p>The strategy of group to "regenerate the bush" is based on its own variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Bradley Method</a>. The effectiveness of this method is proven and is now widely accepted throughout Australian "landcare" groups as the most cost-effective method to regenerated the bush.</p>

<p>
    The Bradley Method is a more &quot;natural&quot; rather than an &quot;artificial&quot; approach to bush regeneration.
</p>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>

    <p>
    The main feature of the Bradley Method is that it emphasises "weeding over planting" because it is believed that an hours weeding gives a much better return than an hours planting. This means that a well targeted and executed weeding strategy can achieve major results more cost effectively than an equivalent planting stategy. The main advantages of weeding over planting are summarised in the following table:
    </p>

    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Planting</th>
            <th>Weeding</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Cost</th>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Low</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Mortality</th>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Low</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Diversity</th>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The effectiveness of the Bradley Method is however counter intuitive to those unfamiliar with it and does not conform with the general publics stereotypical idea of landcare groups.


    <p>Weeding is not sexy or glamourous but it is the single most effective method for regeneration the bush.</p>

    <h3>Effectiveness</h3>

        Planting seems to be the obvious way of restoring native vegetation. However, the main reason why weeding is more effective than planting is that the bush has a natural tendency to regenerate anyway, whether humans help or not. work with nature and not against it. However, humans can great significantly accelerate the natural regeneration process by removing competitors that prevent the bush from regeneration. Weeds compete for light, water and nutrients. Removing weeds allows struggling natives to maximise the use. The idea is to create an empty space for the bush to move into. The bush will do this naturally. All it requires from us is to create this space. This is the main reason for weeding - to remove competition and create a space.Weeding is by no means a futile activity.

        Mother Nature will typically do a much better job or regenerating the bush than humans can. All she needs is a helping hand.
    </p>

    <h3>Application</h3>

    <p>The main areas that are weed are both our <a href="groupareas.php">group areas</a> and our <a href="individualareas.php">individual areas</a>. This is inline with working with the strongest areas first.</p>

    <p>
        This has many benefits
        <ul>
            <li>Foo</li>
            <li>Bar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the group areas and indivual areas have been largley cleared of many weeds. These areas are being gradually expand with the long term goal of connecting these areas together.
    </p>

    <h3>Weeding</h3>

    <p>
        The Bradley Methods maintains that weeding should by lightweight rather than heavy weight. Weeding is most effective in strong areas rather than week areas. Many think that weeding is futile because they will just come back. Once a good native cover is established, most weeds rarely reenter. Work with the bush rather than against it.   immediately next to the weed. By not causing major damage to the surrounding natives. Precision an minimise collateral damage wherever problem. Manual methods are generally preferred to mechanical methods as they are more precise and less likely to create collateral damage.
    </p>

    <p>A well planned and executed weeding stategy can have a major impact on th regeneration of the landscape.</p>

    <p>It is important to understand that weeds are not removed simply because &quot;they don't belong&quot;, but because weeding is the most cost effective method of stimulating natural regrowth. An area that is weeded properly will regenerate much faster than an area that is not weeded or an area that is &quot;artifically&quot; regenerated with direct plantings.</p>


    <h3>Techniques</h3>

    <p>
        Many different weeding techniques are used on the ridge, both by the group itself as well its partners. These include:
    </p>

    <div id="hacking" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Hacking</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/tina.png" style="height:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Hacking is the main form of weeding performed the group. It is generally performed with a small pick and simply involves digging out small weeds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hacking  is most effective against small to medium herbaceous weeds that have a distinctive rosette, such as <a href="weeds.php#aaronsrod">Aaron's Rod</a>, <a href="weeds.php#wildsage">Wild Sage</a>, <a href="weeds.php#scotchthisle">Scotch Thistle</a> and <a href="weeds.php#pattersonscurse">Patterson's Curse</a>. Large areas. It is a very precise method that removes the weed while leaving natives and is great way to regenerate native grasslands.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="poisoning" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Poisoning</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/jan.png" style="height:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Poisoning involves the application of some herbicide to the plant. The herbicide is generally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate">glyophasate</a> based one that does not harm the enviroment nor humans. Some other more specialised poisons are sometimes used for specific weeds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Poisons are typically applied using two different methods - spraying or cut-and-dabbing. Spraying is most effective against weeds that have a large rosette such as <a href="weeds.php#pattersonscurse">Pattersons Curse</a> whereas cut-and-dab is best used with woody weeds such as <a href="weeds.php#sweetbriar">Sweet Briar</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Spraying of specific weeds such as <a href="weeds.php#blackberry">Blackberry</a> is performed by Parks and Conservation officers (or their contractors) using commercial level equipment.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="beheading" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Beheading</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/pt.jpg" style="height:100px;;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Beheading involves the removal of the head or seeding part of the plant while leaving the rest of the plant in place. The head is removed either with some cutting implement or simply by hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although this does not kill the plant, it prevents it from reseeding and thus prevents any future generations from replacing the plant when that plant eventually dies. A concerted course of this technique over several seasons will reduce or eliminate the weed.
            </p>

            <p>
                This technique is best used with slower growing, annual, tall weeds such as <a href="weeds.php#aaronsrod">Aaron's Rod</a> and <a href="weeds.php#fleabane">Fleabane</a>.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="burning" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Burning</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Burning can be effective against some weeds that are not very fire tolerant. A regular burn of infested errors with gradually reduce these weeds over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Burning not only kills many weeds but more importatly triggers the native plants to germinate. See our <a href="fire.php">Fire</a> page for more details.
            </p>

            <p>
                Burning is not directly used by the group but is performed by the ACT Rural Fire Service as part of their <a href="http://www.environment.act.gov.au/ACT-parks-conservation/bushfire_management/prescribed-burns">hazard reduction burn programme</a>. Although the primary intention is not to reduce weeds, burning has many secondary benefits for weed control because it not only kills many weeds but more importatly triggers the native plants to germinate. See our <a href="fire.php">Fire</a> page for more details.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="smothering" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Munching</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/verbascum.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Munching involves using biological agents such as insects to simply eat the weeds. The muchning may kill the plant or may simply weaken it. Alternatively, it may prevent it from reproducing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Biological controls exist for some weeds such as <a href="weeds.php#stjohnswort">St Johns Wort</a> and <a href="weeds.php#pattersonscurse">Pattersons Curse</a>.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="smothering" class="panel panel-success">
        <div class="panel-heading">Smothering</em></div>
        <div class="panel-body">

            <img src="images/doug.png" style="height:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Smothering or mulching involves covering weeds with some substance such as newspaper, plastic sheets or even the remains of other weeds. Smothering is limited by the availability of materials to smother with.
            </p>

            <p>
                The blocking of the light starves the weed of light and it can not photosynthesise and eventually dies of starvation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Smothering is best used on thick infestations of weeds that are difficult to control with other weeds. such as <a href="weeds.php#phalaris">Phalaris</a>.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Each technique is target at the specific weeds concerned. Some weeds are more effectively managed than others.
    Each has its place in the toolkit.
    </p>


    <p>
        Many major weeds our now largely extinct from the ridge and many are well on their way to be declaring them extinct.
