    <p>The ridge is unfortunately lacking in signicant water course.</p>

    <p>There are no permanent water courses found on the ridge.</p>

    <p>There are however two dams found on the ridge.</p>

    <p>These dams have been survey over the years. Please see our <a href="dams.php">Dam Survey</a> page for more details.</p>
