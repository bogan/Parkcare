    <h2 class="page-header">Weeds</h2>

    <p>
        Weeds and weeding are the main focus of the group. There are large number of different types of weeds on the ridge. However, there are only approximately a dozen weed species that constitute the main bulk of the weeds on the ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The group believes that it is important that everybody be able to recognise the weeds, even if they do not actively weed themselves. The first step in helping to solve the problem is to identify the problem. You can help by simply being aware what are weeds and what are not. Most inexperienced people often confuse natives and exotics with one another.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is here to give somebody new to the ridge a gentle introduction to its most signficant weeds.  Each species is quite easy to identify, even for a novice. The following is a shortened list of the main weeds that the Group focuses on. For a complete list of all weeds found on the Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve, please see our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Plant Survey</a>.

        <div class="panel-heading">Blackberry <em>(Rubus fruticosus)</em></div>

            <img src="images/blackberry.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Blackberry is a very large bush that has long canes, thorns and berries. It can grow to be very large and form dense thickets. Blackberry his highly invasive and will spread rapidly if not controlled. It has many means of spreading including seeding and suckering.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ridge has a major blackberry problem, especially on the eastern face of Mt Arawang. The group tracks the position of every known blackberry bush as part of its <a href="blackberrys.php">Blackberry Survey</a> to assist in its control.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blackberry is only effectively treated with poisoning. The poison is normally applied by spraying the leaves of the plant. Blackberrys are typically sprayed in late summer or autumn when they are actively growing and after fruiting. Large infestations require commercial grade equipment such as motor vehicles, pumps and long hoses. Smaller infestations can be poisoned by using a hand held spray pack or by painting the leaves with a herbicide solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Poisoning of blackberry is mainly performed by <a href="partners.php#parksandconservation">Parks and Conservation</a> officers or their contractors rather than the group itself. The group assists the work performed by Parks and Conservation by communicating the location of bushes to Parks and Conservation workers/contractors. The group complements the work performed by ACT Parks and Conservation by controlling smaller infestations before they become to big for the group to control.
            </p>

            <p> N.B. Blackberry is easily confused with the Native Rasberry because they look very similar and are from the same genus.</p>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is a large, thick, perenial tussock grass. It grows well during the spring and dries out in the summer. In mass plantings, it forms thick mats that dominate all other plants. It is a pasture grass that was deliberately planted by former pastoralist to signficantly increase the amount of feed available for their grazing animals. It is a native of Southern Africa and has adapted to being grazed by large herbivores. this makes it suitable as a pasture grass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is also significant because it is the major fuel source and can rapidly increase the speed and intersity of grass fires. Eliminating pharlaris is important part of minimising dangerous grassfires on the ridge. See our <a href="fire.php"> Fire</a> page for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
                This weed is widespread on the ridge. It is generally found on the lower and flatter parts of the ridge that were preferred areas for farmers to convert to pasture. The most significant examples are found on the south west facing slopes of the ridge such as between Lincoln Place and Arawang Homestead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is not very invasive and can be cnntrolled either by <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacking</a> or by <a href="methods.php#poisoning">poisoning</a>. This require multiple treatments over several seasons. The group has made significant progress with removing pharlaris from most of the <a href="groupareas.php">Group Areas</a> but large patches still remain elsewhere on the ridge.

            <p>
                Aaron's Rod is a large herbascieous plant with a large rosette and large vertical stem. It typically germinates in the autumn after rain and grows relatively slowly through the winter and spring. It is a garden escapee
            </p>

            <p>
                 Aaron's Rod is very common in canberra nature parks. It is widely dispersed throughout the ridge. The best examples found are in the <a href="groupareas.php">Kathner Street group area</a>. It is easily identified and is normally the first weed given newcomers to weed.

                St Johns Wort is highly invasive noxious weed. It is one of the few weeds that will invade non damaged errors.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is very common on the wetter and cooler south western slopes of the ridge.

                Most techniques of weed control such as <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacking</a> or <a href="methods.php#poisoning">poisoning</a> are ineffective against St Johns Wort. This is partly dues to the fact that St Johns Wort does not have distinctive rosette to either hack out or poison. It is also has an extensive root system and will reshoot if all the roots are not removed.

            <p>
                Bearded Oats is a perennial, tall, slender and  rapidly growing grass. It is annual that germinates in late winter and rapidly grows to maturity within a few weeks. It dries out rapidly in late spring and early summer and becomes a golden colour. It remains standing until the autumn.
            </p>

            <p>
                This weed is common throughout the ridge and is typically found occurs largely in damaged areas or areas that were heavily grazed (ie. pastured areas). It is most common on the western ends of the ridge around Kathner Street and Chauvel Circuit.

            <p>
                Bearded Oats is also significant because it is major fuel source and can rapidly increase the speed and intensity of grass fires.

            <p>
                Wild Oats is difficult to directly control because both of its speed of growth and the fact that it does not have a rosette that allows it to be easily hacked or sprayed. However it does not compete very well with native grass areas and can easily be indirectly controlled by replacing infested areas with native grasses, which will quickly out competed.
