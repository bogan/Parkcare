    <p>
        Weeds and weeding are central focus of the groups strategy to regenerate the bush on Coolemenan Ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The group believes that it is important that everybody who relates to the ridge we familiar with the history, scope and types of weeds found on the ridge

        The group thinks that this important because most people who come into contact with the ridge to not know this.
        Most inexperienced people often confuse natives and exotics with one another and can do more harm than good.

        The first step in helping to solve the problem is to identify the problem.

        The best may the public can help is to just bo simply aware of the problem, even if they do not actively weed themselves.

        This page is intended to give a general overview of the history, scope and types of weeds found on the ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most weeds are typically found in &quot;damaged areas&quot; of the ridge. These are areas that were deliberately or accidentally altered by human activity. The main reason why the landscape has been dammaged has been the intoduction of grazing. Manny areas were overgrazed. Native cover was removed. This leaves  the exposed soil highly vulnerable to invasive weeds such
    </p>

    <p>
        There are large number of different types of weeds on the ridge. However, there are only approximately a dozen weed species that constitute the main bulk of the weeds on the ridge. Each species is quite easy to identify, even for a novice. The following is a shortened list of the main weeds that the Group focuses on. For a complete list of all weeds found on the Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve, please see our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Plant Survey</a>.

        <div class="panel-heading">Blackberry <em>(Rubus fruticosus)</em></div>

            <img src="images/blackberry.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Blackberry is a very large bush that has long canes, thorns and berries. It can grow to be very large and form dense thickets. Blackberry his highly invasive and will spread rapidly if not controlled. It has many means of spreading including seeding and suckering.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blackberry is a major problem on the ridge. This is especially on the eastern face of Mt Arawang. It will progessively spread. The group tracks the position of every known blackberry bush as part of its <a href="blackberrys.php">Blackberry Survey</a> to assist in its control.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blackberry is difficult to control and requires an approach quite different to other major weeds on the ridge. It  is only effectively treated with poisoning. The poison is normally applied by spraying the leaves of the plant. Blackberrys are typically sprayed in late summer or autumn when they are actively growing and after fruiting. Large infestations require commercial grade equipment such as motor vehicles, pumps and long hoses. Smaller infestations can be poisoned by using a hand held spray pack or by painting the leaves with a herbicide solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Poisoning of blackberry is mainly performed by <a href="partners.php#parksandconservation">Parks and Conservation</a> officers or their contractors rather than the group itself. The group assists the work performed by Parks and Conservation by communicating the location of bushes to Parks and Conservation workers/contractors. The group complements the work performed by ACT Parks and Conservation by controlling smaller infestations before they become to big for the group to control.
            </p>

            <p> N.B. Blackberry is easily confused with the Native Rasberry because they look very similar and are from the same genus.</p>

            <img src="images/phalaris.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px;float:left;padding:0px;margin: 5px"/>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is a large, thick, perenial tussock grass. It grows well during the spring and dries out in the summer. In mass plantings, it forms thick mats that dominate all other plants. It is a pasture grass that was deliberately planted by former pastoralist to signficantly increase the amount of feed available for their grazing animals. It is a native of Southern Africa and has adapted to being grazed by large herbivores. this makes it suitable as a pasture grass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is also significant because it is the major fuel source and can rapidly increase the speed and intersity of grass fires. Eliminating pharlaris is important part of minimising dangerous grassfires on the ridge. See our <a href="fire.php"> Fire</a> page for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
                This weed is widespread on the ridge. It is generally found on the lower and flatter parts of the ridge that were preferred areas for farmers to convert to pasture. The most significant examples are found on the south west facing slopes of the ridge such as between Lincoln Place and Arawang Homestead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Canary Grass is not very invasive and can be cnntrolled either by <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacking</a> or by <a href="methods.php#poisoning">poisoning</a>. This require multiple treatments over several seasons. The group has made significant progress with removing pharlaris from most of the <a href="groupareas.php">Group Areas</a> but large patches still remain elsewhere on the ridge.

            <p>
                Aaron's Rod is a large herbasceous plant with a large rosette and large vertical stem. It typically germinates in the autumn after rain and grows relatively slowly through the winter and spring. It is a garden escapee.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Aaron's Rod is very common in Canberra nature parks and is widely dispersed throughout the ridge. The best examples found are in the <a href="groupareas.php">Kathner Street group area</a>. It is easily identified and is normally the first weed newcomers weed.
            </p>

            <p>
               Aaron's Rod is easy to control and responds well to <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacking</a>, <a href="methods.php#beheading">beheading</a> or <a href="methods.php#poisoning">poisoning</a>. The group has been able to largely eliminate this weed in each of the group areas.

                Wild Sage is a herbaceous weed that is closely related to culniary sage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wild Sage is fairly widespread on the ridge. It occurs in areas that have been damaged. The best example of significant infestations are at Group Area Darrell Place and Group Area Lincoln Place.

            <p>
                St Johns Wort is highly invasive noxious weed. It germinates in the late winter and seeds in the spring. St Johns Wort is significant because it is one of the few weeds that will invade non damaged errors.
            </p>

            <p>
                St Johns Wort is a major problem on the ridge. Its presence has increase significantly in recent years and the ridge now has large infestations of it. It is most common on the wetter and cooler south western slopes of the ridge above the various horse paddocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most techniques of weed control such as <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacking</a> or <a href="methods.php#poisoning">poisoning</a> are ineffective against St Johns Wort. This is partly due to the fact that St Johns Wort does not have a distinctive rosette to either hack out or poison. It is also has an extensive root system and will reshoot if all the roots are not removed. The only control method for St Johns Wort that is available is a <a href="methods.php#biological">biological</a> control with the presence of the St Johns Wort beetle.

            <p>
                African Lovegrass is a small grass that grows on bads soils. It is blueish grey when growing and becomes golden brown as it dries out during the warmer months. It is a prolific seeder and a highly invasive weed that will colonise damaged areas quickly and forms monocultures that crowd all ofther natives out. It is also spread by grass mowing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ridge has some significant patches of African Lovegrass. The most signficant example is found around the large reservoir above Darrell Place. It is also often found along fire management tracks where mowing is more frequent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lovegrass is reasonably easy to control and can be <a href="methods.php#hacked">hacked</a> out or <a href="methods.php#hacked">poisoned</a>. Small local localised infestations of lovegrass are regularly controlled by the group to prevent further spreading but large uncontrolled patches remain. It has been largely controlled in the <a href="groupareas.php">Group Areas</a> but remains a major problem outside of them.

            <p>
                Patterson's Curse is a small to medium sized herbaceous weed. It has bright purple leaves and is very fast growing. It prefers deep wet soils. It takes off in wet periods at any time of the year, rapidly flowers and seeds, before quickly dying off in dry periods. It is an opportunistic grower and can occur during any season. It is a highly prolific seeder and infestations can be extremely dense. It is highly invasive of disturbed ground by does not compete well with good quality native cover.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ridge has had large infestations of Paterson's Curse in the past especially on the western end of the ridge. The most signficant example is found around the Kathner Street Dam.
            </p>

            <p>
                Patterson's Curse is reasonably easy to control and can be <a href="methods.php#hacking">hacked</a> out or <a href="methods.php#hacking">poisoned</a>. It is critical that Pattersons curse is replaced with native cover quickly or else repeat infestations will easily occur.

            <p>
                Bearded Oats is a perennial, tall, slender and rapidly growing grass. It is annual that germinates in late winter and rapidly grows to maturity within a few weeks. It dries out rapidly in late spring and early summer and becomes a golden colour. It remains standing until the autumn.
            </p>

            <p>
                This weed is common throughout the ridge and is typically found in damaged areas that have been heavily grazed (ie. pastured areas). It is most common on the western ends of the ridge around Kathner Street and Chauvel Circuit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bearded Oats is also significant because it is major fuel source and can rapidly increase the speed and intensity of grass fires. Eliminating Bearded Oats is an important part of the groups strategy to minimise dangerous grassfires on the ridge. See our <a href="fire.php"> Fire</a> page for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wild Oats is difficult to directly control because both of its speed of growth and the fact that it does not have a rosette that allows it to be easily hacked or sprayed. However it does not compete very well with native grass areas and can easily be indirectly controlled by replacing infested areas with native grasses, which will quickly out competed.
