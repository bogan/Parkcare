    <p>Most inexperienced people often confuse natives and exotics with one another.</p>

    <p>There are many different weeds on the ridge but there are probably a dozen or so main weeds that the group works on.</p>

    <p>This page is designed to give somebody new to the ridge a gentle introduction to these signficant weeds.</p>



    <p>The first step in helping to solve the problem is to identify the problem. You can help by simply being aware what are weeds and what are not.</p>

    <p>The following is a shortened list of the main weeds that the Group focuses on. For a complete list of all weeds found on the Cooleman Ridge Nature Reserve, please see our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method">Plant Survey</a>.</p>
